### a streamlit application for interacting with the arabidopsis plantobo

- analyzes all the plant ontologies.
- analyzes also the association of the plant ontologies with the plant obo terms.
- analyzes also the name suggestions.
- analyzes also the names for the ontologies. 
```
conda install streamlit
git clone https://github.com/gauravcodepro/streamlit-arabidopsis-interact-graphviz.git
cd streamlit-arabidopsis-interact-graphviz
streamlit run arabidopsis-app.py
```
- Following the prompt resources for this application.
