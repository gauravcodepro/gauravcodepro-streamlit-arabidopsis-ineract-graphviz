### a streamlit application for interacting with the arabidopsis ontolgoies

- analyzes all the plant ontologies.
- analyzes also the association of the plant ontologies with the plant obo terms.
- analyzes also the name suggestions.
- analyzes also the names for the ontologies.
- provide the file path to the po_anatomy_gene_arabidopsis_tair.assoc and po.obo and to.obo for analysis
```
